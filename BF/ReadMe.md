# Blackbox fuzzing technique 

BF implementation takes two arguments as inputs â€“ the Application Binary Interface (ABI), and a bytecode file. These are generated from the Solidity contract with
the Solidity compiler.  Our implementation supports all Solidity types such as signed/unsigned integers types with widths ranging from 8 to 256 bits. The generated
inputs call each of the functions in the smart contract and are written into a JSON file.
