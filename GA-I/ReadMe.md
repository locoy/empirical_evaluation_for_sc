# Genetic Algorithm with Single Objective

Our implementation of GA-I in Java takes 9 arguments as inputs. 4 out of 9 inputs are ABI, name of the contract, bytecode and opcode files.We use these four arguments to generate the first random population. 
The remaining 5 arguments are directly related to GA operators â€“ namely, size of the population, minimum desired coverage, number of iterations, mutation rate and 
crossover rate.
